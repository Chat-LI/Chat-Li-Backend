_Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?_

### Regular check-ins at 9am

- Recap the day before
  - Successes
  - Failures
  - How are you doing, feeling about your work, your contributions to the project
- Review the upcoming day
  - What do we need to finish from yesterday
  - What (else) can we accomplish today
  - Who will be working on what?

### Daily wrap-up - including code review of major branches/feature merges

## Conflict Plan

_Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary._

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

- Determine how much we care about certain things (scale of 1 to 5), the person with a lower score should potentially be willing to concede to the person to whom it matters more. Give each party the floor for a short uninterrupted period of time to state their case.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

- If someone has concerns with another individual, bring it up with them in a 1-on-1 setting and not with the entire group. Be mindful, ask questions, and be empathetic.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

- Regular check-ins and communication. If something is unclear with someone, ask for help. If someone asks you for clarification, teach them.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

- If someone has concerns with another individual, bring it up with them in a 1-on-1 setting and not with the entire group. Be mindful, ask questions, and be empathetic.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

- Maintain professionalism. If concerns aren't addressed in a 1-on-1 scenario, discuss with other teammates(?), then escalate to a higher authority.

## Communication Plan

_Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up._

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

- 9am - 6pm Monday-Friday

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

- Slack and GitHub Projects

**How often will you take breaks?**

- As needed, tentative lunch break at noon

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

- Only work on MVP features until back on track

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

- Via slack

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

- Frequent group meetings will be held during scheduled working hours where every team member will have a chance to voice their concerns and discuss their progress or ideas.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

- When team meetings are held, we’ll make sure everyone has spoken on the topics. No raining on other’s idea-parades.

## Work Plan

_Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts._

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

- All of these will be addressed in our regular stand-ups.

**What project management tool will be used?**

- GitHub Project to manage tasks.

## Git Process

_Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks._

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

- Everything except private or personal information, e.g. any kind of key or secret

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

- Via Git Organization - all members are Admins Once repos is added, we will all push up on different branches as needed

**What is your Git flow?**

- Start the day by pulling down the codebase. Stay in communication to ensure we're not duplicating efforts or potential merge conflicts. Merge working features as needed with the development branch. Once a day have 2+ members coordinate merging working code from the development branch to the main branch.

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**

**How many people must review a PR?**

- Two reviews for main branch

**Who merges PRs?**

- Whoever feels most confident in someone else's code, or the main author of a pull request’s content will merge it. If a pull request is denied, the denier will leave meaningful comments as to why.

**How often will you merge?**

- At least once a day.

**How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**

- Depends, will communicate with the team via Slack/Remo.
