# Software Requirements

## Vision

_Minimum Length: 3-5 sentences_

### What is the vision of this product?

### What pain point does this project solve?

### Why should we care about your product?

## Scope (In/Out)

IN - What will your product do

- Describe the individual features that your product will do.
- High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5
- Example:
  - The web app will provide information to the users about all the different Cat Cafe’s in the area
  - The web app will provide both walking and driving directions to each of the destinations
  - Users will be able to “Star” their favorite shops.
  - Each shop will contain reviews of the customer’s experiences

OUT - What will your product not do

- These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

### Minimum Viable Product vs

What are your stretch goals?

### Stretch

What stretch goals are you going to aim for?

## Functional Requirements

List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

1. An admin can create and delete user accounts
1. A user can update their profile information
1. A user can search all of the products in the inventory

### Data Flow

Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

## Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)

Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

1. Security
1. Usability
1. Testability
1. etc….

Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
